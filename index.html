???

- my English sucks,
- I'm not a git expert, and it's the first time I gave this talk and any talk (in general)
- I underestimated the time needed to prepare this talk
- *"En casa de Herrero, cuchillo de palo"*<br />
*"In the Blacksmith's house, it is used wooden knive"*<br />
I lost my slides yesterday afternoon because I didn't use any VCS

# Intro

<img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/distributed.png" width="350" style="float:right" />
- Git is a Version Control System (VCS)
- It is quite new. It was released in **2005**
- Goals
  - Speed
  - Simple design
  - Non-linear development (performance in branches)
  - Scalable to huge projects
  - Fully distributed
- Most of operations are done locally
- Updaing remotes is done only from time to time

???

- **New**, if you was born in the 80'
- **Performance**, as being developed for support the development of the Linux kernel
- Being **distributed** means that you have a full local copy of the history.
So you can ruin things, and also recover them from a remote repository.

---

# Intro

- Git commands only use to add information to the DB
- CLI commands are the Git core. GUI tools run over CLI commands.
- Git commands are widely documented
```shell
$ git help <verb>
$ git <verb> --help
$ man git-<verb>
```

# Concepts
## Commits
- Commits are snapshots, not diffs
  ```go
  Commit {
      message string
      commiter UseEmail
      commitDate timestamp
      author UseEmail
      authorDate timestamp
      tree Hash //root directory
      parents []Hash //of the parent commits
  }
  ```

**Git Has Integrity**. Every single commit is identified by a SHA1 Hash.

https://blog.thoughtram.io/git/2014/11/18/the-anatomy-of-a-git-commit.html

---

# Concepts
## States

- **.git** (git DB) where is stored the repository data
- StagingArea, or **Index**: stores the changes done after the last checkout, as they will be converted into a commit if you `git commit`
- **Working directory**: is the sandbox where you play

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics

???

- If you delete your .git folder:
  - all the repo info will be deleted,
  - you need to recover that folder without git
    - from a remote repo: `git init` and `git remote add`
    - from another storage: backup, cloud...

# Concepts
## Branches
- A branch is a pointer to a single commit
  ```shell
  $ cat .git/refs/heads/master 
  bfafe2db6c0bcf0fdd01682e05e5c981fd993b8c
  ```
- A branch is an alive pointer: it's updated when you commit over it.

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell

---

# Concepts
## Branches

In a normal working state (not detached): **HEAD**: points to a branch
```shell
$ cat .git/HEAD 
ref: refs/heads/master
```
If you are not on a branch (detached): **HEAD**: points to a commit
```shell
$ cat .git/HEAD 
f153cae02cc9e90b0f07a73bd28e6287a1468d65
```
You can create a branch from that point doing:
```shell
$ git checkout {-b|-B} <newBranchName>
```

**master** is not a special branch; it is just a name given to a long term branch

---

# Concepts
## Tags

It is a **pointer** to a commit.

It is a static pointer, so it is not updated (like a branch pointer)

There are two types:
- annotated tags **preferred ones**
- lightweight tags

```shell
$ git tag -ln [pattern]
$ git tag -a <tagName> -m <message> <refference> [-f] #annotated
$ git tag -d <tagName>
```

They need to be explicitily pushed to be shared
```shell
$ git push <remoteName> <tagName>
```

---

# Concepts
## Fork

A **fork** is a GitHub concept, base on the term "remote repository".

- It is created from certain "remote repository", that is taken as an "original"
- Its history is created as a full copy of the "original" one
- It is a "remote repository" owned by a certain used

If you copy manually a git repository, it is not considered a fork by github, but
the copied repository will share most of the "fork" characteristics

# Basics
## Recording changes

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="assets/graphs-states-working.png" width="400" />
</div>

```shell
$ touch newFile
$ git add new.file
$ echo "new line" >> existing.file
$ git add existing.file
$ git rm removed.file
$ git commit -m "Record changes"
```

## Working with remotes

Remote repositories are versions of the same project that are hosted somewhere

Starting a git repo
```shell
$ git init
$ git remote add <remoteName> <remoteUrl>
```
or
```shell
$ git clone <remoteUrl>
```

**origin** is not a special remote; it is just a name given to the one used for the clone

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository

???

Depending if you want to start from a remote repository,
or if you have already things in your computer

---

# Basics. Working with remotes

You can list/add/rename/remove remotes whenever you want

```shell
$ git remote -v
$ git remote add <shortname> <url>
$ git remote rename <shortname> <newShortname>
$ git remote remove <shortname>
```

References of remote branches are stored localy; you can update them doing

```shell
$ git remote update #updates all your remotes
$ git remote update <shortname>
$ git fetch <shortname>
```

References of remote branches are also updated when you pull and push

Remote branches are only updated with `git push` command

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes

---

# Basics
## Branching

You can create a branch doing:
```shell
$ git branch <branchName>
$ git checkout -{b|B} <branchName>
```

You can list branches and change between them with:
```shell
$ git branch -v[a]
$ git checkout [-f] <branchName>
```
If you have not staged changes, and they can not be applied over the target branch
the checkout command will cry, and the checkout will not be allowed.

In that case, you can stash, commit, create a temporal branch...

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell

---

# Basics. Branching


```shell
$ git merge <branchName>
```
When you merge two branches, it can be:
- a **fast-forward**, if the merged branch is reachable from the current one
- a **commit merge**, if both branches has commits after his last common commit

**Conflicts** are those situations when the merge commit can not be done with a "fast-forward"
and "three-way merge" can not be cleanly done because incompatible editions on merge children 

To **resolve a conflict** it is needed to edit the involved files, removing the "conflict markers",
to add them into the staging area again, and then to commit.

You can **abort a commit** doing

```shell
$ git merge --abort
```
